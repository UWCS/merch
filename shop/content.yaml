            OwO what's this?

            Unleash your full programming potential with these lovely, colour-coordinated, thigh-high socks! Guaranteed to increase your mark by at least 10* percentage points across all modules. They only come in a single size, but they are quite stretchy. I wanted to call these CompSocks but they wouldn't let me - Keegan

            For when a T-Shirt doesn't quite protect you from the elements, introducing our brand new, state of the art, never seen before invention - a pull-over hoodie! We have "Warwick Computing" down the sleeve to show how utterly irresistible you are to everyone, the dots logo on the other, and the society's shield logo on the chest of this comfortable hoodie.

        - title: Zipped Hoodie
          desc: |
            Turns out adding a zip actually bumps up the cost a fair bit. Even so, it's an excellent alternative to awkwardly trying to take the hoodie off in public. As with the other design, we have "Warwick Computing" down one sleeve, the dots logo on the other, and the society's shield logo on the chest of this comfortable hoodie.
