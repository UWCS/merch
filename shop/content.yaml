    # Welcome to UWCS Shop
    Greetings, valued members of the University of Warwick Computing Society! It is my pleasure to welcome you to our very own Uwcs Shop - your one-stop destination for all things tech-y and chic. 
 
    We are proud to offer a range of high-quality products that are sure to delight and inspire any computer savvy individual. From cozy, stylish hoodies to colorful, eye-catching stickers, we have everything you need to show off your tech pride in style.
 
    But that's not all! We also have a brand new addition to our collection - programming socks. These socks are not just practical and comfortable, but also a testament to our passion for programming and algorithms. 
 
    Our team at Uwcs have carefully crafted every item with attention to detail, ensuring that every product meets our high standards of quality and durability. 
 
    So what are you waiting for? Browse our range online, or visit us in person to get your hands on the latest tech gear. Trust us, you won't be disappointed. Thank you for choosing Uwcs Shop - where tech meets fashion!

    Unfortunately, last year, the SU got annoyed at us subsidising you guys' merch, **so we have to sell exactly at cost**. We are not allowed to subsidise or profit on anything, except we are allowed to subsidise exec hoodies and give away free non-clothing items, go figure.

We have "Warwick Computing" down the sleeve to show how utterly irresistible you are to everyone, the dots logo on the other, and the society's shield logo on the chest of this comfortable hoodie.

            Turns out adding a zip actually bumps up the cost a fair bit. Even so, it's an excellent alternative to awkwardly trying to take the hoodie off in public. As with the other design, we have "Warwick Computing" down one sleeve, the dots logo on the other, and the society's shield logo on the chest of this comfortable hoodie.
